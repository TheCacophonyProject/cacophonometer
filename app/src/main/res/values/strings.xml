    <string name="help_text_welcome">Thank you for installing the Bird Monitor app.  The app will automatically make audio recordings at random intervals during the day - averaging 32 recordings/day. Recordings will be uploaded to the Cacophony Project data server.  This will allow monitoring of birdsong near your phone.  To use this app, first complete the setup steps (swipe to move through the screens in turn).\n\nThank you again for supporting The Cacophony Project https://cacophony.org.nz/ </string>
    <string name="help_text_create_account">The Bird Monitor is designed to work with an account on the Cacophony server.  Please fill in the form to create your account, or if you already have an account you can skip this step.</string>
    <string name="help_text_sign_in">Signing in, will enable you to create a group on the server, or select a group that you have previously created.\n\nIf you already know the group that you are going to use with this phone, you can skip this step.</string>
    <string name="help_text_create_or_choose_group">Your phone needs to be registered with a group on the server.  If you signed in on the previous page, you will see a list of groups associated with your account.\n\nYou can either select one of the groups or create a new group.</string>
    <string name="help_text_test_record">Using the Record Now button will allow you to get feedback on whether your phone has been setup correctly.  \n\nThe app will record for the normal length of one minute, so you will need to wait that long.  A series of messages are displayed to give you feedback on the progress of recording and uploading to the server.  \n\nThe Record Now button is disabled (greyed out) if a recording is already in progress, or if the app has been disabled.  You can enable the app from the Main\\Home screen.  Once the file(s) have been uploaded, you can confirm this by checking on the server page.</string>
    <string name="help_text_register_phone">Once you have created a group on the server, you can enter it in the \'Group Name\' field, and also enter a unique name for your phone (at least 4 characters).\n\nPress the button to register.  You will see  messages informing you of progress - the last message should say that registration has been successful.\n\nYou can un-register this device if you want to change either the group or name.</string>
    <string name="help_text_battery">Normally the app will not record when the battery is getting low.  But, you can ignore a low battery when out walking or if you have just left the phone somewhere without power and you want it to keep recording until the battery goes flat. \n\nNote: It is NOT advisable to use this option if you are using a solar panel as once the battery has gone completely flat, the phone is very unlikely to turn back on even if the solar panel re-charges the battery.</string>
    <string name="help_text_turn_off_or_on">You may want to prevent the app from making recordings.  This is useful if you have installed the app on a phone that you are now keeping close to you.\n\nIf you choose this option, the \‘Disable Recording\’ button on the home screen will instead display \'Enable Recording\'.</string>
    <string name="help_text_frequency">Upload after every recording: If you are not concerned with how much power your phone is using and you can’t wait to hear your birds, then this option will upload each recording as soon as it has finished – rather than every six hours.</string>
    <string name="help_text_gps_location">Setting the GPS allows the location of your recordings to be known.  This can help identify birds and will allow spatial mapping to occur.\n\nPress the button to set or update the location (you may be asked to turn on the phone\'s location/gps service).\n\nThe phone may take a few minutes to get a location, and you may need to go outside.</string>
    <string name="help_text_internet_connection">The App can work in a number of internet connection configurations - BUT it is most likely that your will use it in \'Normal\' mode. \n\nIf your phone has been rooted, \’Normal\’ mode will enable the phones flight (airplane) mode to save power.  If the phone has NOT been rooted, still use Normal mode and the app will work just fine. \n\nIf you are going to be using the phone to make recordings in a location that you know has no internet connection, then use \’Offline\’ mode and the app will not waste power by attempting to acquire an internet connection.  Also manually enable airplane mode as the phone will not be able to do this automatically if it hasn\’t been rooted. \n\n\'Online\' mode will not enable airplane mode.  It requires the phone to be plugged into the mains power supply as it will use too much power to work with a solar panel.  Online mode is useful if you want to remotely access your phone, perhaps because you have remote control software installed.  If the phone isn\’t in Online mode, you would be very unlikely to be able to connect to the phone.</string>
    <string name="help_text_rooted"> If the phone is rooted Bird Monitor can use some extra settings.\n\nAeroplane Mode\nIn order to save power Bird Monitor will enable Aeroplane mode in between recordings \n\nAuto Update\nBird Monitor will check for updates, if found it will download and install them.\n\nIf you got this phone from The Cacophony Project, please leave these settings as you found them.</string>
    <string name="help_text_warning_sound">Play a short warning sound before a recording is made (useful for when out walking with the phone or testing at home). \n\nNote: using an external microphone will probably disable this function.</string>
    <string name="help_text_settings_for_testing">App Testers: Use the test server which will allow you to increase the recording frequency and use short recordings. Note: Data and recordings on the server are likely to be wiped at some point.</string>
    <string name="help_text_manage_recordings">Normally you will not need to \’Manage Recordings\’ as the app will automatically upload your recordings to the server.\n\nHowever, if you have been using the phone without an internet connection (perhaps you have been for a walk or have just re-established an internet connection after leaving your phone to make recordings in a location without out internet access) you can now use this screen to upload all the recordings on the phone.  \n\nBefore you press the upload button, the number of recordings currently on the phone is displayed and should change to zero if all the recordings are successfully uploaded.\n\nIf you prefer, you can delete all the recordings on the phone – perhaps you didn’t realize you had been making recordings! Careful with this option – you can’t get them back.</string>
    <string name="help_text_settings_for_audio_source">Take a look at: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaRecorder.AudioSource</string>
    <string name="help_text_settings_for_bird_count">The Bird Count feature aims to replicate the typical senario of sitting at a location and manually counting birds.\n\nWhen you do a normal 5 minute bird count you can record it with this application and it will send it to our database with GPS and time stamp so it can archived for future analysis.\n\nChoose the most appropriate duration and press the Record button.\n\nYou can also press the \'ADD NOTES\' button to add extra information about the most recent recording (if it hasn\'t already been uploaded).\n\nFor best results use an external microphone - https://www.2040.co.nz/.  \n\nIf you don\'t want recordings to be automatically uploaded, enable Offline mode (see the Internet Connection screen under Advanced).</string>
    <string name="help_text_settings_for_sun_alarms">Use scheduled alarms relative to sunrise, noon and sunset.\nWhen enabled the normal randomly distributed recordings will be disabled and recordings will be made relative to sunrise, noon and sunset offset by the given values.</string>

    <string name="help_text_vitals">The Vitals screen displays some useful information about the status of the app.  \n\nVersion ID is the version of this App. \n\nRequired Permission should have a tick to show that the app is able to do recording and access the internet. \n\nRegistered should have a tick to indicate that the app has successfully registerd.\n\nLogged on to Server should have a tick to show that connection to the server can be established. \n\nDevice name should show the name that you gave your phone. \n\nLatitude and Longitude display the GPS location of the phone for the last time the GPS was successfully updated. \n\nLast Recording gives the date and time of the last recording, and Next Recording indicates the time that the next recording is set to occur.  If the phone app is currently disabled it says Disabled. \n\nMessages displays any extra information.</string>

    <string name="help_text_walking">Walking mode is designed for using when you are out for a walk!  If you are just going to leave the phone in a fixed location, walking mode should be set to OFF.  \n\nIn walking mode, the phone will automatically do the following: make a recording every 15 minutes, periodically update the GPS location,  it will not attempt to upload the recordings to the server, will keep recording when the battery is getting low and attempt to make a warning sound (an external microphone and/or other phone settings may mute this feature). \n\nSee the Manage Recordings screen (in Advanced) for when you have finished your walk.</string>
